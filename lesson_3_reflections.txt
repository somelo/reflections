When would you like to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When trying to access to the same project from different computers or to do collaborative work.
Commands learnt in this section:
- git remote: to see all the remote repositories in my local computer,
- git remote add origin https...: to add a remote repository created manually on github and call it origin,
- git remote -v: to see the remotes in more detail,
- git push origin master: to sync the remote repository origin with local repository master.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
