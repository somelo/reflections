What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a "file" called .git, it is necessary to make a directory a repository and track it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the in-between the repository and the working directory. 
It is useful to commit additions in logical groups and not commit by file.
This lesson I learnt new git commands:
- git init: creates new repository
- git add file1: adds the file to the staging area

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
